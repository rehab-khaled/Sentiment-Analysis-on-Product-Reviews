description: This Decision Tree model offers a solid balance between precision and
  recall, with a slightly higher recall than precision. It is a good option for explainability
  and easy interpretation of decision boundaries, making it suitable for applications
  where model transparency is essential. However, it might slightly overfit compared
  to Random Forest.
